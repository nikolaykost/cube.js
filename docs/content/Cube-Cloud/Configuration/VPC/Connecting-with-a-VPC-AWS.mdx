## Prerequisites

To allow Cube Cloud to connect to a VPC on AWS, the following information is
required:

- **AWS Account ID:** The AWS account ID of the VPC owner.
- **AWS Region:** [The AWS region][aws-docs-regions] that the VPC resides in.
  Ensure that the region is available in [Supported Regions](#supported-regions)
  to see if Cube Cloud VPC connectivity is available in your region.
- **AWS VPC ID:** The ID of the VPC that Cube Cloud will connect to.
- **AWS VPC CIDR:** The CIDR block of the VPC that Cube Cloud will connect to.

## Setup

### VPC Peering

After receiving the information above, Cube Cloud will send a [VPC peering
request][aws-docs-vpc-peering] that must be accepted, either through the [AWS
Web Console][aws-console] or through an IaC tool.

To accept the VPC peering request through the AWS Web Console, follow [the
instructions here][aws-docs-accept-vpc-peering] with the following amendments:

- On Step 4, verify the peering request is from Cube Cloud by checking that the
  region and VPC IDs match the [Supported Regions](#supported-regions).
- On Step 5, ensure **Modify my route tables now** is selected so that the
  necessary routes are created.
- After Step 5, the security group for any databases within the VPC
  [may require updating](#updating-security-groups) to allow traffic from
  Cube Cloud.

## Supported Regions

| Region         | VPC ID         | CIDR                 |
| -------------- | -------------- | -------------------- |
| `ca-central-1` | `XXXXXXXXXXXX` | `XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX/XX` |
| `eu-central-1` | `XXXXXXXXXXXX` | `XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX/XX` |
| `eu-west-1`    | `XXXXXXXXXXXX` | `XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX/XX` |
| `us-east-1`    | `XXXXXXXXXXXX` | `XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX/XX` |
| `us-east-2`    | `XXXXXXXXXXXX` | `XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX/XX` |
| `us-west-2`    | `XXXXXXXXXXXX` | `XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX/XX` |
